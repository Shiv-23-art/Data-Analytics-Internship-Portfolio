# Customer Churn & Segmentation Analysis

Objective:
Analyze customer churn behavior, segment users based on tenure and churn probability, and generate retention-focused business insights.

Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, SHAP, ELI5)
- Power BI
- CSV Dataset

Project Scope:
- Cleaned and prepared customer data in Python
- Built churn scoring logic and segmentation framework
- Defined customer segments based on tenure and churn likelihood
- Visualized churn patterns and revenue distribution in Power BI

Customer Segments:
- Loyal: High tenure, low churn probability
- General: Moderate tenure and churn risk
- Dormant: New customers with low engagement
- At Risk: High churn probability, low tenure
- Churned: Customers who exited

Key Metrics:
- Total Customers: 7,032
- Total Revenue: $16.06M
- Average Tenure: 32.42 months
- Churn Rate: 26.58%

Key Insights:
- General segment represents the largest portion of the customer base.
- Churned customers typically have shorter tenure and rely on electronic check payments.
- Loyal customers contribute the highest average revenue.
- Churn probability decreases as tenure increases, indicating early-stage attrition risk.

Business Implication:
Early engagement strategies and payment-method risk monitoring can significantly reduce churn and improve long-term revenue retention.
