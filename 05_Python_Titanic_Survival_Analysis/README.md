# Titanic Survival Analysis

Objective:
Perform exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling on the Titanic dataset to identify factors influencing passenger survival.

Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

Work Performed:
- Handled missing values and inconsistent data
- Encoded categorical variables for modeling
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed survival patterns across gender, class, and age groups
- Applied basic classification modeling for survival prediction

Key Insights:
- Gender was a strong predictor of survival probability.
- Passenger class significantly influenced survival outcomes.
- Age distribution showed variation in survival likelihood across groups.
Technical Focus:
Emphasis was placed on data preprocessing, feature handling, and understanding dataset structure before applying predictive techniques.
